# CloudRays ARI+

ARI+ is an enhanced version of the [Azure Resource Inventory](https://github.com/microsoft/ARI) (ARI) tool. ARI is a robust PowerShell script provided by Microsoft that generates an Excel report of any Azure environment to which you have read access. This tool aims to assist Cloud Administrators and other professionals in creating a comprehensive Excel report of an Azure Environment quickly and easily. ARI+ enhances the original script by capturing additional utilization metrics. This repository is professionally maintained by AWS, focusing exclusively on read-only integrations with Azure API's and Azure Monitor.

## Prerequisites

ARI+ can be executed in both Azure Cloudshell and PowerShell Desktop environments. 

### Requirements
> **Note:** By default, Azure Resource Inventory will attempt to install the necessary PowerShell modules and Azure CLI components, but you need administrator privileges during the script execution.


- PowerShell 7 or Azure CloudShell
- Azure CLI
- Azure CLI Account Extension
- Azure CLI Resource-Graph Extension


### Dependencies

Install the required PowerShell module:

```powershell
Install-Module ImportExcel
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `ResourceInventory.ps1` script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stefoy/AriPlus
```

## Running the Script

ARI+ uses concurrency to execute commands in parallel, especially when gathering metrics. By default, the concurrency limit is set to 6. To change this, use the `-ConcurrencyLimit` option. 

2. If you are in Azure CloudShell, you're already authenticated. In PowerShell Desktop, you will be redirected to the Azure sign-in page.

```powershell
./ResourceInventory.ps1 -ConcurrencyLimit 8
```

## Script Output/Reports
3. When the script has completed, a zip file of the report will be saved in the folder **_AriPlusReports._**
     - ARI+ will create 4 files and one zip 
         - Consumption_ResourcesReport_(date).json 
         - Inventory_ResourcesReport_(date).json 
         - Metrics_ResourcesReport_(date).json 
         - ResourcesReport_(date).xlsx 

     - These 4 files zipped up automatically and the zip is what is sent back to AWS
         - ResourcesReport_(date).zip

## ⚠️ Warning Messages

- **Important:** Azure Resource Inventory will not upgrade the current version of the Powershell modules.
  
- **Important:** If you're running the script inside Azure CloudShell, the final Excel will not have auto-fit columns, and you will see warnings during the script execution. This is an issue with the Import-Excel module but it does not affect the inventory which will remain accurate.
